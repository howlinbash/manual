os x kernal

xnu
x is not unix
Mach 
BSD
I/O-Kit

==Mach==

Mach is not a monolithic kernal it is a microkernal
developed by CMU (carnegie Mellon University)

=Monolithic Kernals=
EGs of MLKs: unix BSD Linux
other components run kernal mode like
API, DEV, NET, SEC, VFS.

=vs. microkernals=
with an MK only vital components like
scheduler, memory manager, IPC inter process communication...
the others are operated by user mode

=advantages=
with less components reliant on the kernal, the system is more secure.
