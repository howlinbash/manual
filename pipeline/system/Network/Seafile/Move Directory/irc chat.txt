afternoon all. i'm trying to setup a time machine backup on my r-Pi. i have a partitioned nas. both 'ext4 relatime 0 2'. guide tells me i need to setup netatalk with 'ext4 noexec,defaults  0   0' FSTAB settings. Q1: can i ignore this and run an operational netatalk time capsule with the current config? Q2, if not, is it likely that I can reconfigure 2nd (empty) partition as they instruct without loosing any data or in anyway messing up the first partition (which must remain as 'ext4 relatime 0 2' and is not empty)? or Q3. Do i have to take my data from the first partition back it up (this takes 12hours) and just redo the whole thing from scratch?. Thanks for your help.
