20:15:16      Jusii | I'd guess you have it formatted as fat32                                                                                                                             │ DropBear_
20:16:08      Jusii | then your only option is to tell linux mount time what permissions all of the files should have                                                                      │ DustyDin1o
20:16:29      Jusii | with some linux filesystem, they can differ and not be all the same                                                                                                  │ dwalt
20:19:25 holy_moses | that sounds pretty complex. i'm pretty ignorant. if i change from fat32 to ext4 is will the harddrive still work fine with my mac in finder and cli ssh. i'm trying  │ eao
                    | out owncloud but i dont want t be wedded to it as i experimient with all of these new toys.                                                                          │ edenist
20:21:00      Jusii | not really familiar with osx, looks like it needs some driver, paragon extfs                                                                                         │ eggy
20:22:01      Jusii | another option would then be make big enough image file on it and format that as ext4, then mount that image in RPi                                                  │ Elderx___

20:23:02 holy_moses | Jusii: thanks for the advice. i'll have a look into these options.                                                                                                   │ Eremiell
20:23:53      Jusii | maybe adding this to your current fstab after noatime: umask=007 would work too                                                                                      │ evil_dan2wi
20:24:46      Jusii | then all files will have permissions 770 but you wont be able to change them.                                                                                        │ eXtremo
20:26:02      Jusii | quick note how to make and image file on external disk and mount it in linux:                                                                                        │ fjen_
