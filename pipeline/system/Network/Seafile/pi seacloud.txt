Hello, just setting up seafile on RPi. Seems nice and simple [phew] however, i think i'm running into trouble with my file permissions on my chosen install directory.

I have a usb hard drive setup in the /media directory but the server setup keeps crashing out because it can't create the directory it needs to etc, etc. How should i setup my permissions for that directory if this is indeed the problem and if it is not any guesses on what the problem might be? Many thanks.

                    | example a init script or systemd service file you should check what user   │ hejsan1
