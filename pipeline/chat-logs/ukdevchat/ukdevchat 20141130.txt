14:48:50       Galas | no, php is backend imo, though a frontend developer will have some familiarity with PHP because of the endpoints in templating                                                  │

14:49:40 adamski2600 | two-gun: php can render frontend views, so what you see on the frontend can depend on what's going on server side                                                               │
14:50:05     two-gun | yeah it's gonna be hard for me to stay focused sticking to front-end to begin with just always want to see the complete picture.                                                │
14:50:12       Galas | yeah, it's not a clear separation                                                                                                                                               │

20:02:17       Galas | basically from what I see from my friends the two years is that time when things become nicer in terms of employment prospects                                                  │

20:07:44 adamski2600 | they're actually open sourcing .net which is great, but for me it's so far removed from everything else. It's fairly easy to transition from one language to another or one     │

20:11:55 adamski2600 | I love how they have certifications you can spend 100s of £s on to become a 'magento professional'                                                                              │
20:11:58       Galas | I just think it's a legacy option                                                                                                                                               │
20:13:11       Galas | it's a question of modernisation                                                                                                                                                │
20:13:39       Galas | Sinical, essentially you have 4 layers                                                                                                                                          │
20:13:42       Galas | you have the database                                                                                                                                                           │
20:13:45       Galas | you have the backend                                                                                                                                                            │
20:13:47       Galas | the frontend                                                                                                                                                                    │
20:14:20       Galas | the backend mainly interacts with the server and the db                                                                                                                         │
20:14:54       Galas | the front exists in the browser and renders the views and the interaction                                                                                                       │
20:15:45       Galas | so essentially what the user sees                                                                                                                                               │
20:15:55     Sinical | Yeah just feels like I know little snippets but actually building it into something tangible is where I get lost                                                                │
20:16:09       Galas | so for instance if you are using rails                                                                                                                                          │
20:16:36       Galas | rails runs on a DB, let's go for mysql for praticality                                                                                                                          │
20:16:44       Galas | it defines your models                                                                                                                                                          │
20:16:49       Galas | your business logic in the controllers                                                                                                                                          │
20:16:54       Galas | and finally renders the views                                                                                                                                                   │
20:17:09       Galas | which you can then style accordingly                                                                                                                                            │
20:18:00 adamski2600 | what are you coding in Sinical? try building some simple projects that use backend and frontend, you'll soon visualise how it all fits together                                 │
20:18:28       Galas | sorry business logic in the model, the controller acts upon the model                                                                                                           │
20:18:30     Sinical | Well I can handle the front end fine, but its PHP that I'm finding the disconnect happens                                                                                       │
